    "# Reliable Fully Local RAG Agents with LangGraph, Map Reduce, Parallelization, and Thread Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how **thread memory** enhances the performance of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agents by providing context through previous interactions. Additionally, improvements to prompts, graph state, and nodes, as well as the integration of new models for structured output, are showcased.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Is Thread Memory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread memory, also referred to as **chat history**, allows the RAG agent to remember previous interactions in the conversation. By storing and referencing past messages, the agent can make more contextually relevant decisions, leading to more coherent and personalized responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread memory enables the agent to recall prior conversation history, improving its ability to maintain context over longer interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How It Improves RAG Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of thread memory improves RAG agents by:\n",
    "- **Contextual Awareness**: The agent can recall past interactions, ensuring responses are coherent and contextually accurate.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Dialogue Quality**: With thread memory, the chatbot can provide more personalized and relevant answers based on previous messages.\n",
    "- **Improved Decision Making**: The agent uses thread memory to better understand user intent and adjust responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread memory improves RAG agents in the following ways:\n",
    "- **Longer Context Retention**: The agent can remember previous messages, ensuring more accurate responses over time.\n",
    "- **Personalized Interactions**: The chatbot can tailor responses based on prior conversations, enhancing user experience.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Combined with MapReduce and Parallelization, thread memory boosts the agent’s ability to process and respond more effectively, leveraging previous context to make decisions faster.\n"

    "   - Avoid unnecessary headers, symbols, or line breaks.\n",
    "   - Structure the response as a single clean paragraph or structured list.\n",
    "6. **Transparency**: If the context does not contain sufficient information:\n",
