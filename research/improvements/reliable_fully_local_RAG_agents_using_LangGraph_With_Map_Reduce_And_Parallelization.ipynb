    "# Reliable Fully Local RAG Agents using LangGraph With Map Reduce And Parallelization\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how **parallelization** enhances the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents by executing tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What Is Parallelization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelization refers to the process of splitting a computational task into smaller sub-tasks, allowing them to be processed simultaneously. This approach reduces execution time and increases the efficiency of handling large-scale computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this notebook, parallelization is used to execute two independent nodes concurrently, speeding up the overall process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How It Improves RAG Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging parallelization, this notebook enables:\n",
    "- **Parallel Task Execution**: Tasks such as grading answers and hallucination evaluation are processed simultaneously, improving overall speed.\n",
    "- **Faster Decision Making**: The agent can perform both evaluations in parallel, speeding up the process of generating or retrieving answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using parallelization improves the RAG agent in the following ways:\n",
    "- **Increased Speed**: By executing multiple tasks at the same time, the agent can deliver results faster.\n",
    "- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces processing time, enabling quicker decision-making.\n",
    "- **Simplified Workflow**: Parallel execution of tasks allows for simultaneous operations without additional complexity."

However, a\\nplayer who has in hand the tile which is represented by a joker on the table, the player can\\nsubstitute the real tile for the joker and then re-use the joker in some combination on the table.
