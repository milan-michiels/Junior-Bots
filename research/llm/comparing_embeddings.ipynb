    "# Comparing two embedding models\n",
    "In this notebook we will compare two different embedding models, `nomic-embed-text` and `mxbai-embed-large`, by running the same questions on both of them and comparing the results. We compared the results of the two models to determine which one provides better answers to the questions. Then we asked chatGPT to compare the two answers and provide feedback on which one is better. At the end we chose the best model based on the comparison and feedback."

    "nomic has a better response because it was clear and concise. mxbai's response was too verbose and did not provide a clear answer to the question. But I think the mxbai response is not that good because the quality of the docs is not that good. I still need to fix that.\n",

    "**Best Answer: Llama3.1_nomic**\n",
    "Llama3.1_nomic provides a clear and accurate answer that aligns with the standard rules of Rummikub. It succinctly explains the win conditions (playing all tiles or having the lowest tile count if the pool is empty) and mentions the tie-breaking rule. The response is concise, well-structured, and directly relevant to the question.\n",

    "**Why Others are Less Good:**\n",

    "- **Llama3.1_mxbai**: This response introduces concepts and scoring mechanics that are unrelated to Rummikub's standard rules, such as \"Open Hand,\" \"Foot,\" and \"Closed Hand,\" which might confuse users. It also lacks clarity and relevance, making it unsuitable for players looking for accurate guidance on winning the game. While the mention of the joker is interesting, it is contextually irrelevant to the core win conditions."

    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Meld**: A player must play their initial meld before they can retrieve a joker.\n",
    "2. **Clearing the Joker**: There are four ways to clear a joker:\n",
    "\t* Replacing it with tiles on the rack or table that match its value (e.g., three 3s).\n",
    "\t* Splitting a run and clearing the joker.\n",
    "\t* Adding a tile to complete a set, which clears the joker.\n",
    "\t* Substituting a real tile for the joker if you have it in hand.\n",
    "3. **Combination Manipulation**: A combination with a joker can be expanded by adding tiles, but not rearranged or modified while the joker is present.\n",
    "4. **Tile Representation**: The joker represents a specific tile and cannot be changed unless the player supplies the original tile from their hand.\n",

    "* Using a joker as any tile in a set\n",

    "Llama3.1_nomic offers a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the joker's functions, covering its versatility and the specific rules for clearing and manipulating it. The response is well-structured, addressing multiple scenarios such as initial melds, clearing methods, and limitations. It is both informative and aligned with standard Rummikub rules, making it the best choice for a user seeking clarity and accuracy.\n",

    "- **Llama3.1_mxbai**: This response provides a basic explanation of the joker’s use but lacks depth and clarity. While it mentions retrieving and using jokers in sets, it omits critical details about clearing methods and restrictions on rearranging combinations with jokers. The explanation feels incomplete and less user-friendly compared to Llama3.1_nomic.\n"
